# Abstract
For this project, we designed and built a website that would allow users to add recipes to a meal plan and store their ingredients in a virtual pantry. Users can also search all of the recipes on the site, as well. We used TDD principles to implement the testing of all of our class and instance methods, as well as Mocha, Chai, and NPM. The website was built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

## Install

First, fork the repo and then clone it down using ```git clone```. 

After you have cloned down the repository, enter the directory. 

Then, run ```npm install``` in the command line in order to install necessary dependencies. 

You can now view the website by running the command ```open src/index.html``` in the command line. 

Additionally, you can view the deployed site via this link: 

## Design 
Both collaborators created separate designs for the website, which were merged in order to create the final product. Ally created a wireframe using Balsamiq, and December created a mockup using Sketch. Views from both designs are below:
